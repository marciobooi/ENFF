    'C0371': `Blast Furnace Gas (BFG) is a by-product gas generated during iron production in blast furnaces, rich in carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen (N2) but with low heating value, primarily used as a fuel within steelworks or for power generation after cleaning. It's a key energy source for steel plants, supporting operations like preheating blast air and producing steam, reducing reliance on external fuels.
What it is:
A combustible gas produced from the chemical reactions when coke burns and reduces iron ore in a blast furnace.
Composed mainly of nitrogen (~51%), carbon dioxide (~22%), carbon monoxide (~22%), and hydrogen (~5%).
How it's used (according to Eurostat/EEA guidance):
Internal Fuel: Recovered and burned within the steel plant for heat, power, and steam.
Air Heating: Used to preheat the hot air (blast) fed into the furnace.
Energy Generation: Can fuel boilers and power plants.
Energy Balance: For statistical reporting, BFG use is often treated as part of the energy sector's transformation processes, not final consumption, to avoid double counting.
Key Characteristics:
Low Heating Value: Due to high N2 and CO2 content.
High Density: One of the densest industrial gases.
By-product: A valuable energy source recovered from primary iron making.`,

    'C0000X0350-0370': `solid fossil fuels are fossil fuels in solid form, primarily different types of coal (like hard coal, brown coal, anthracite, lignite), along with derived coal products (coke, briquettes), peat, oil shale, and oil sands, all consisting of carbonized plant matter used for energy. These are distinct from liquid (petroleum) or gaseous (natural gas) fossil fuels and represent a significant, though declining, part of the EU's energy mix, often used in industry and power generation.
Key Components (Eurostat's classification):
Primary Coal: Hard coal (anthracite, coking coal, bituminous), brown coal (lignite).
Derived Coal Products: Coke oven coke, gas coke, coal tar, brown coal briquettes.
Peat: Peat and peat products.
Other Solids: Oil shale and oil sands.
Usage:
Industrial Energy: A major source for industries, especially in the iron and steel sector, for producing manufactured gases like coke oven gas.
Power Generation: Historically significant, though its share has been decreasing in favor of renewables and natural gas.
Trends:
Eurostat data shows a long-term downward trend in the consumption and production of solid fossil fuels in the EU, interrupted by occasional fluctuations, with renewables increasingly taking a larger share.`,

    'C0100': `hard coal is a high-rank, high-energy fossil fuel (like anthracite or bituminous coal) with a gross calorific value over 24,000 kJ/kg, characterized by high fixed carbon and low volatile matter, primarily used in industry (like steelmaking) and electricity generation, though its use in the EU is declining rapidly as solar power overtakes it as a source.
Key Characteristics & Uses:
High Energy Content: It has a greater heating value than lower-ranked coals like brown coal (lignite).
High Carbon Content: Contains a high percentage of fixed carbon.
Industrial Applications: Crucial for industries such as steelmaking (as coking coal) and also used for electricity generation.
Types: Includes anthracite (highest rank) and bituminous coal (coking coal and steam coal).
Eurostat Context:
Declining Trend: Eurostat data shows a significant decrease in hard coal production and consumption in the EU, with its share in electricity generation falling behind renewables and natural gas.
Key Producers & Consumers: Poland and Czechia are the main EU producers, while countries like Poland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands are major consumers.
Supply Shifts: Following sanctions on Russia, the EU diversified its suppliers, with Australia and the U.S. becoming major sources.`,

    'C0110': `Anthracite is the highest rank of coal, a hard, lustrous, black coal with the highest carbon content (typically over 90%) and lowest volatile matter, making it a high-quality fuel for industrial and residential heating, often classified under "hard coal" in energy statistics. It's formed under intense heat and pressure, making it very dense and slow-burning, distinct from lower-rank coals like lignite (brown coal).
Key Characteristics (Eurostat/Statistical Context):
High Rank: It's the most mature form of coal, with the highest fixed carbon content.
High Calorific Value: It provides significant heat energy, with a gross calorific value over 24,000 kJ/kg (ash-free, moist basis).
Low Volatile Matter: Contains less than 10% volatile matter, meaning it burns cleanly and slowly.
Hard Coal: Anthracite falls under the broader category of "hard coal" in EU energy statistics, along with coking coal and other bituminous coals.
Usage:
Primarily used for industrial and residential heating.
Its quality makes it suitable for specific solid fuel appliances.
EU Context:
Production and consumption of anthracite (hard coal) have significantly declined in the EU as the bloc moves away from fossil fuels, with solar power surpassing hard coal as an electricity source in 2022.`,

    'C0121': `coking coal is high-grade bituminous coal with specific caking properties (swelling and fusing when heated) that allow it to be transformed into coke for the iron and steel industry, acting as an energy source, chemical agent, and structural support in blast furnaces. It's crucial for steelmaking, making it a critical raw material for the EU due to high import dependency, with Eurostat tracking its production, imports, and consumption within energy statistics.
Key Characteristics & Role:
Caking Properties: It softens, swells, and binds together when heated without oxygen, forming strong, porous coke.
Metallurgical Use: Primarily processed into coke for blast furnaces, where it reduces iron ore to iron.
Energy & Chemistry: Serves as both a fuel (energy source) and a carbon source (chemical agent) in steel production.
Critical Raw Material: The EU lists it as critical due to its importance for strategic sectors like automotive and its high import reliance, with Eurostat monitoring its flow.
Eurostat's Role:
Collects data on coking coal's transformation (inputs/outputs in coke ovens), stocks, imports, and consumption across energy sectors.
Uses detailed instructions for reporting to ensure consistent energy statistics for policy and analysis.`,

    'C0129': `Other bituminous coal also called thermal coal, is a hard coal used primarily for steam-raising (power generation), distinguished from coking coal (for steelmaking) and anthracite. It's a shiny, layered coal with more volatile matter than anthracite (over 10%) but less fixed carbon (under 90%), and a high heating value (over 24,000 kJ/kg).
Key Characteristics:
Use: Primarily for electricity generation (steam raising).
Classification: Falls under "hard coal" but is not coking coal or anthracite.
Composition: Higher volatile matter than anthracite (over 10%) and lower fixed carbon (under 90%).
Energy: High calorific value (over 24,000 kJ/kg) on an ash-free, moist basis, hence also known as thermal coal.
Appearance: Often shiny and smooth, potentially with dull/shiny layers, and generally black.
In essence, if it's a bituminous coal that isn't good enough for coking (making coke for blast furnaces) and isn't anthracite, it's classified as "other bituminous coal" for thermal energy purposes.`
