C0371 = Eurostat defines Blast Furnace Gas (BFG) as a by-product gas generated during iron production in blast furnaces, rich in carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen (N2) but with low heating value, primarily used as a fuel within steelworks or for power generation after cleaning. It's a key energy source for steel plants, supporting operations like preheating blast air and producing steam, reducing reliance on external fuels. 
What it is:
A combustible gas produced from the chemical reactions when coke burns and reduces iron ore in a blast furnace.
Composed mainly of nitrogen (~51%), carbon dioxide (~22%), carbon monoxide (~22%), and hydrogen (~5%). 
How it's used (according to Eurostat/EEA guidance):
Internal Fuel: Recovered and burned within the steel plant for heat, power, and steam.
Air Heating: Used to preheat the hot air (blast) fed into the furnace.
Energy Generation: Can fuel boilers and power plants.
Energy Balance: For statistical reporting, BFG use is often treated as part of the energy sector's transformation processes, not final consumption, to avoid double counting. 
Key Characteristics:
Low Heating Value: Due to high N2 and CO2 content.
High Density: One of the densest industrial gases.
By-product: A valuable energy source recovered from primary iron making.
